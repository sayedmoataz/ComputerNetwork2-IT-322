Create a network application (chat or file transfer application) that allows the  following: 
1- Print a list of all connected hosts (e.g. Ahmed@192.168.0.10) in your  network. 
2- Send a one-to-one message (or file) to another connected host in the  network. 
3- Send a broadcast message (or file) to all connected hosts in the network  using your network address (Donâ€™t use any kind of loops).  
    
    To Test this application, you need to connect at least 3 PCs (Laptops).
